  - You are being haunted...
  - You must escape...
  - Find seven stone pillars and cast my spell on them by holding the E key...
  - It's after you...
  - You better hurry...
  - Although I am weak, I can lend a helping hand to you. If you are lost, press
    F and I will guide you to the next pillar...
  - As I said, I am weak, I can only guide you 2 times...
  - Good luck!
